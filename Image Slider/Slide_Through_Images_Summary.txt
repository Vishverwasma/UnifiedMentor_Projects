# Slide Through Images

 Project Overview
The 'Slide Through Images' project is designed to create an interactive and user-friendly image slider using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases a series of images that can be navigated through either automatically or manually by the user. The slider is built to provide a smooth and aesthetically pleasing user experience.

 Features
- Auto Slide: The images automatically change every 5 seconds, creating a dynamic presentation without user interaction.
- Manual Navigation: Users can manually navigate through the images using 'Previous' and 'Next' buttons.
- Navigation Dots: Users can jump directly to a specific image by clicking on the corresponding dot below the slider.
- Responsive Design: The slider adapts to various screen sizes and maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio, ensuring it looks great on all devices.
- Animation Effects: Smooth fade-in effects are applied when transitioning between images.

 Technologies Used
- HTML5: Provides the structure for the image slider.
- CSS3: Used for styling the slider, including layout, animations, and responsiveness.
- JavaScript: Handles the interactive elements, such as the auto-slide feature and navigation controls.
